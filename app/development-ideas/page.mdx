# Development ideas

To enhance user experience and ease navigation within the application, the following changes are 
proposed for the list of endpoints and the application's URL structure.

The new URL structure and design will be tested using a temporary folder in the app folder. 
The name of the folder is `new-structure`. 
Inside that folder, there will be a new `components` folder with the new 
components for the new structure. 
If the new structure is approved, it will be moved to the main app folder.


## New URL list 

### Public (General users)
- **Main page** `/` 
  - It should show a welcome hero, a button to go to explore courses, and a button to go to the about page. 
- **Courses** `/courses`

[^1]: Present a comprehensive list of available courses, incorporating filtering options
by categories, a search bar for direct queries, and pagination to manage the display of numerous courses effectively.

  - Course details. [^2]
  [^2]: Offer detailed information about the course, 
  including its syllabus, instructor details, user reviews, and enrollment options.
