# Development ideas

- Remove zustand as the data fetching library is good enough for the project. 

## New URL list 

### Public (General users)
- **Main page** `/` 
  - It should show a welcome hero, a button to go to explore courses, and a button to go to the about page. 
- **Courses** `/courses`
  - List of available courses. [^1]
[^1]: Present a comprehensive list of available courses, incorporating filtering options
by categories, a search bar for direct queries, and pagination to manage the display of numerous courses effectively.
- **Course detail**  `/courses/:id` 
  - Course details. [^2]
  [^2]: Offer detailed information about the course, 
  including its syllabus, instructor details, user reviews, and enrollment options.

### Instructors
- **Instructor sign-up** `/instructor/signup`
  - A form to create a new instructor account. 
    -It should create a new user if it doesn't exist, and assign the role of instructor. 
    - If the user already exists and is not an instructor, it should include the role of instructor.
    - If the user is logged in and it have the instructor role, it should redirect to
    the instructor dashboard.
    - If the user is logged in and it doesn't have the instructor role, it should ask if the user
    wants to be an instructor and add the role if the user accepts.
- **Instructor dashboard** `/instructor`
  - A central hub for instructors to view and manage their courses.
- **Edit a course** `/instructor/courses/:id/edit`
  - A form to edit an existing course.
- **Manage courses** `/instructor/courses`
  - A list of courses created by the instructor, with options to edit, delete, and view details.

### Students
- **Student dashboard** `/student`
  - A central hub for students to view and manage their courses.
- **Enroll in a course** `/courses/:id/enroll`
  - A page to enroll in a course.


## Models 
For data models, the following structure is proposed for the Course model:

- Title: Should be clear and concise.
- Description: Provides an overview of the course.
- Availability: A boolean to indicate if the course is currently available.
- Categories: An array of strings categorizing the course.
