# Development ideas

To enhance user experience and ease navigation within the application, the following changes are 
proposed for the list of endpoints and the application's URL structure.

## New URL list 

### Public (General users)
- **Main page** `/` 
  - It should show a welcome hero, a button to go to explore courses, and a button to go to the about page. 
- **Courses** `/courses`
  - It should show a list of available courses. 
- **Course detail**  `/courses/:id` 
  - It should show the course details. 

### Instructors
- **Instructor dashboard** `/instructor`
  - A central hub for instructors to view and manage their courses.
- **Create a course** `/instructor/courses/new`
  - A form to create a new course.
- **Edit a course** `/instructor/courses/:id/edit`
  - A form to edit an existing course.
- **Manage courses** `/instructor/courses`
  - A list of courses created by the instructor, with options to edit, delete, and view details.

### Students
- **Student dashboard** `/student`
  - A central hub for students to view and manage their courses.
- **Enroll in a course** `/courses/:id/enroll`
